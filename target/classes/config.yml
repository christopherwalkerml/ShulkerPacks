# BLACKLIST AUCTION INVENTORIES HERE
# blacklist works as follows:
# if you include the word "a" in the blacklist, every inventory with the letter "a" will be blocked.
# because of this, try to be as precise as possible.
# If your inventory contains extra characters, such as "Auction Page 8", simply blacklisting "Auction Page" will block every page
